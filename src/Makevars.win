## With Rcpp 0.11.0 and later, we no longer need to set PKG_LIBS as there is
## no user-facing library. The include path to headers is already set by R.
PKG_CXXFLAGS = -I../inst/include -I. $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS)
PKG_LIBS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS) $(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS)

## With R 3.1.0 or later, you can uncomment the following line to tell R to 
## enable compilation with C++11 (or even C++14) where available
#CXX_STD = CXX11
