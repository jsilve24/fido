# fido 0.1.13

* tons of tiny changes to prepare for version 0.2 (and ultimately CRAN) featured changes include:
* plot and coef methods for *fit objects now abide by CRAN generic naming scheme - may cause
  some problems if prior code had positional arguments to these functions
* now being tested using travis integration (vignettes not tested there due to time constraints)
* merged Kim's fixes to maltipoo code (will almost certainly change maltipoo results; there
  had been a bug in prior versions)
* Internally stored mallard and mallard_family data now import as `mallard` and `mallard_family` 
  rather than both importing as `ps`. Solved a R CMD CHECK warning. 
* Lots of tiny updates to documentation 

# fido 0.1.12

* orthus added for jointly fitting multinomial and gaussian data (e.g., 16S microbiome and metabolomics data)

# fido 0.1.11

* Kim fixed windows installation problems (Thanks Kim!)
* Fixed bug in predict that was effecting ppc
* Fixed error when pars!=NULL in summary
* lambda_to_iqlr now had default behavior when focus.cov=NULL
* Fixed issue with Xi=NULL in pibblefit when trying to transform
* small changes to make pibble wrapper around c++ functions faster

# fido 0.1.10

* basset added for fitting non-linear regression using fido
* numerous changes to make installation easier
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
